          <h4>Guest Introduction:</h4>
          <p>
            Frank is one of the leading online instructors in Udemy, and has
            taught over 5 lakhs students across the world which include more
            than 3,80,000 students with 4.5 average reviews just in Udemy. In
            the past years with just 13 courses, he has made more than 1 million
            dollars. Frank is an incredible Teacher, Senior Developer, Technical
            Lead, and an amazing author. Frank spent 9 years at Amazon and IMDb
            where he was on developing and managing the technology that
            automatically delivers product and movie recommendations to hundreds
            of millions of customers all the time. Frank holds 17 issued patents
            in the fields of Distributed computing, Data Mining, and Machine
            Learning. Back in 2012, Frank left to start his own successful
            company, Sundog Software, which focuses on virtual reality
            environment technology and teaching others about machine learning
            through Sundog Education. I’ve been a huge fan of him for a very
            long time, the incredible thing about Frank, despite his huge
            impact, frank stays so grounded and so much accessible. On top of
            all of that, he is an incredible human who made a huge shift from
            corporate to self-employment. I can’t wait anymore to welcome Frank
            Kane.
